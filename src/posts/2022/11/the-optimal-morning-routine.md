I have recently watched a video by [@AfterSkool](https://www.youtube.com/@AfterSkool) on how to have [The Optimal Morning Routing](https://youtu.be/gR_f-iwUGY4).

Here is what I learn:

1. The number one important thing is sleep. _You should try to get good sleep 80% of the time._
2. Get natural light in your eyes within 1-hour of waking up
   - Try to get 5-10 minutes of sunlight in the morning.
   - This sets your level of alertness, focus and mood.
   - You need photons in sunlight. The light from your digital device is not enough.
   - This triggers dopamine â€” which drives motivation, craving and pursuit. _Dopamine is not a molecul of pleasure_.
3. Delay the intake of caffeine 60-90 minutes after waking up.
4. Excercise: hydrate and train to clear out adenosine.

ðŸ’¡ Try to increase your body temperature during your time awake. Eg: cold shower can increase your body temperature.
