Dang! Got a car crash. This came as the worst timing in life.

Gonna look for an apartment. My parents are coming to the US. Gonna take them to places.

Now, it's gone.

My gf and I were sitting closest to the impact. Somehow we survived. All of us survived. This makes me wonder how fragile life is.

Yet, the image of the headlights coming towards us closer and closer is still in my mind, on a loop.

More, the thought of driving a car is so unsafe. There's no built-in mechanism to limit the car from speeding up. You give a really powerful vehicle to a bad driver.

_Anyway, I'm so grateful to be here._
