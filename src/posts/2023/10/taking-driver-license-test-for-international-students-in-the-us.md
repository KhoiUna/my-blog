# Intro

In the US, you need to pass 2 rounds to get the official permit:

1. Computer test - tests you about rules, car signals, traffic signs, etc.
2. Road test - a examiner will sit next to you and see how you drive, then evaluate.

# What you need to bring

To take a driver's license (_both computer test and road test_) in the US, **YOU** will need your:

- I-20
- I-94
- Letter of Good Standing - you can request this from your school Office of Internation Affairs/DSO.
