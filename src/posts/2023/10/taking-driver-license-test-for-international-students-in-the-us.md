# Intro

In the US, you need to pass 2 rounds to get the official permit:

1. Computer test - tests you about rules, car signals, traffic signs, etc.
2. Road test - a examiner will sit next to you and see how you drive, then evaluate.

# What you need to bring

To take a driver's license (_both computer test and road test_) in the US, **YOU** will need your:

- I-20
- I-94
- Letter of Good Standing - you can request this from your school Office of Internation Affairs/DSO.
- SSN _or_ Letter of authorization to bypass SSN
- Passport

For taking the **road test**, the **CAR'S OWNER** has to provide his/her:

- Driver license
- Insurance ID Card
- Car tag info

# Renew your driver license

To renew, you need:

- I-20
- I-94
- Letter of Good Standing - you can request this from your school Office of Internation Affairs/DSO.
- SSN _or_ Letter of authorization to bypass SSN
- Passport

Make sure the program end date on your latest I-20 is **at least 150 days away** (_may differ between states_) from the day you try to renew your driver license. Or, you have to wait for your EAD card to arrive to renew, but not before.

> It's good practice to renew your driver license six months ahead of the expiration date.

In short, **don't apply for OPT unless you've renewed your driver license**.

> It's illegal to drive with an expired driver license, and fines can be costly.
