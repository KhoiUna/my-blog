I will graduate this December. My parents got their visas to visit me in the US.

I still have not found a job offer. So obviously to make them proud, everyone in my family proud, my girlfriend proud, and most importantly myself proud, I must secure a job offer.

I'll have to find an apartment &mdash; a place to live while doing my job search.

Lots of things are coming at once.

_Gotta give my best._
