# Windows vs Linux

Here's a pretty simple to table showing the differences:

| Windows     | Linux                |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Proprietary | Free and open source |
| Graphical   | Can be terminal only |

# Windows Event Log

Is an in-depth record of events related to the system, security, and application stored on a Windows operating system.

Event logs can be used to track system and some application issues and forecast future problems.

> Event logs ensure our server stay available. Ensure our files remain untampered.

## Main elements of Windows Event Log

**Log Name:** Name of the event log to which events from different logging components will be written. Events are commonly logged for system, security, and applications.

**Event Date/Time:** Includes the date and time when the event occurred.

**Task Category:** Identifies the type of recorded event log. Application developers can also define task categories to serve as extra information about the event.

**Event ID:** This Windows identification number helps network administrators uniquely identify a specific logged event.

**Source:** Name of the program or software causing the event log.

**Level:** Event level represents the severity of the recorded event log. These include _information, error, verbose, warning, and critical_.

**User:** Name of the user who logged onto the Windows computer when the event occurred.

**Computer:** Name of the computer logging the event.

## Types of Windows Logs

**Application:** events related to a software/application.

**Security:** related to safety of system. Eg: failed logins, file deletions, etc.

**Setup:** occur during installation of Windows OS. On domain controllers, this log record events related to Active Directory.

> Domain controller — a server that responds to security authentication requests within a network domain.

> Active Directory — think of it as team grouping.

**System:** related to system & its components. Eg: failure to load boot-start driver.

# Linux Event Logs

> Kernel is the brain of the computer.

To view logs in Linux, here're quite a few locations:

-   **/var/log/syslog** or **/var/log/messages**
    -   RedHat-based systems store info in the **_messages_** folder while Debian-based store in **_syslog_** folder.
-   **/var/log/auth.log** or **/var/log/secure —** authentication & authorization logs
-   **/var/log/kern.log —** kernel activity logs, including custom kernels.
-   **/var/log/faillog —** failed login attempts
-   **/var/log/maillog** or **/var/log/mail.log** — track issues like spam emails, suspicious use of postfix or smtpd.

# Vulnerability Scanning

-   Enables organizations to **monitor** their networks, systems, and applications for **security vulnerabilities**.
-   Vulnerabilities can include (but aren’t limited to):
    -   Open ports
    -   Unpatched machines
    -   Out of date software
    -   SSL certificate anomalies
    -   Malware on a device

> Remember to close unused ports for security!

## Vulnerability Scanning & CVEs

Vulnerability scan may include **CVE numbers** in your results.

-   **CVE**: **C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures — refers to publicly known system vulnerabilities.

# In the world of vulnerability scanning, there are 2 main types of system.

## Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

> This system is completely passive.

**Analyzes traffic** that passes through the network. If it sees something that is **abnormal** it’s going to **send an alert**.

## Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)

> This system is active.

**Monitors a single host** for **suspicious activity** by **analyzing events** occurring within that host.

HIPS aims to **stop malware** by monitoring the behavior of code.
