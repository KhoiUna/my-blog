I am proud to have presented at Huntsville's {% newtab_link 'https://www.nationalcybersummit.com/' 'National Cyber Summit'%} for the cybersecurity startup that I had interned with called {% newtab_link 'https://github.com/ossillate-inc' 'Ossillate Inc' %}.

We build a tool called {% newtab_link 'https://packj.dev/' 'Packj' %} with a goal to stop Solarwinds, ESLint, and PyTorch-like attacks by flagging malicious/vulnerable open-source dependencies ("weak links") in your software supply-chain.

<!-- excerpt -->

For me, I was fortunate to have this opportunity if not for my boss, {% newtab_link 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashishbijlani/' 'Ashish Bijlani' %}. While interning at Ossillate, I told him to sign up for NCS, which I thought could help the company to reach out to more customers. But not long after (maybe a few months) I finished my internship, Ashish reached out to me again to present at NCS for him, since it was a long trip for him to come to Huntsville and travel compensation was not provided.

So there you go, here are some photos of me presenting at the conference!
