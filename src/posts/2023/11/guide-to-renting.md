# Apartment vs Condo

| Apartment                  | Condo                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 owner for entire complex | Separate owner for each unit                                  |
| Likely to raise rent       | Less likely to raise rent; more responsive to repair requests |

# Cost of renting

There are fees to consider:

- Application fees
- Parking fees
- Pet fees
- Move-in and move-out fees

> Pro tip: avoid buying new furniture and ask about utilities cost.

# Evaluate the unit

Check the area: neighborhood, pests, etc.

Consider buying renterâ€™s insurance.

Record a video of your unit before you move in.

> Do not pay a deposit or sign a lease until you have visited the place!

# How much rent can you afford

Use after-tax income for your rent budget.

> Rule of thumb: 25% of your monthly take-home pay after taxes
