Here are a few things I found interesting about Go:

1. Go is _sort of_ Object-Oriented.

   - Go has no classes &rarr; no type inheritance.
   - You can define custom interfaces, custom structs (structs — data structures — can have member fields).
   - Custom types can implement 1 or more interfaces. Custom types can have member methods.

2. There's only one way to write a loop — the "for" loop. There is no "while...do..." or "do...while...".

3. Designed as a next-gen lang for C. Go borrows syntax from C, Pascal, etc.
