# SOAR

SOAR stands for **Security Orchestration, Automation and Response**.

It is a technology solution that aims to streamline and **automate** the security operations process by integrating various security tools and processes (eg: SIEM, threat intelligence, etc.) into a single platform.

SOAR platform can automatically collect and analyze security alerts from multiple sources, correlate events to identify potential threats, and initiate a response based on pre-defined playbooks.

→ Help organizations respond more quickly and effectively.

# SOAR Playbooks

SOAR platforms typically provide a range of pre-built playbooks that can be customized to meet an organization's specific security needs.
These playbooks are based on industry-standard frameworks and best practices. These include:

- {%newtab_link 'https://github.com/demisto/COPS' 'COPS'%} — provides a standardized way for SOAR platforms to communicate with different systems & devices to ensure that security policies are consistently enforced across an organization's IT infrastructure.
-  {%newtab_link 'https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v1.0/security-playbooks-v1.0.html' 'OASIS CACAO'%} — defines a set of reusable & shareable artifacts, including use case templates, workflows, & playbooks.
-   {%newtab_link 'https://github.com/atc-project/atc-react' 'RE&ACT'%} — provides a standardized way for SOAR platforms to exchange info & automate security operations. By using a common language and framework, RE&ACT aims to improve the ability of organizations to protect their assets & data.
