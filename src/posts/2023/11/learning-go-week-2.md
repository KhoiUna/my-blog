Speed-running has been my method of learning Go for the past week. Having learnt Python and C, I skipped some parts of {%newtab_link 'https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1' 'A Tour of Go'%} that I felt confident.

The parts that I think I need to work on more are probably pointers (_since I've worked with Python most of the time_) and choosing between _a value or pointer receiver_ for functions, still haven't done much of that part.

I also found this guide, {%newtab_link 'https://go.dev/talks/2013/bestpractices.slide' 'Go Twelve Best Practices'%}, which I thinks is useful for Go learners like me. I still need to work on more apps to get these _best practices_ in my head.

Anyway, I was just bored that I found this guide on how to build a {%newtab_link 'https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin' 'basic RESTful API with Go and Gin'%}. It's fun to build some small projects to learn. Also, love how Go's package manager is already built in with the Go CLI. If you want to install a package, just do:

```bash
go get <package nanme / GitHub URL>
```
