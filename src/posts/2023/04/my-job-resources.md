As an international student from Vietnam studying in the US. I am currently pursuing a Dual Degree BBA in Computer Information Systems and BS in Information Technology at the [University of North Alabama (UNA)](https://www.una.edu/).

<!-- excerpt -->

Throughout my time here, I have applied for a lot of internships, faced lots of rejections, and eventually landed some in the most unexpected way.

I will share with you some resources that has been useful to me along the way to pursue a career in the US.

# Tips

- Invest in yourself.

  > Buy reputable online courses & certificates to specialize your skills.

- Post contents on LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc.

  > Post what you learn and don't overthink it. Make sure you are providing values or showcase your knowledge.

- Go to networking events, career fairs, and conferences.

  > In addition, you can reach out to professors and alumnis.
