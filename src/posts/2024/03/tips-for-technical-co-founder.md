# Ideating

1. Build prototype ASAP in a matter of days.
2. Create 90/10 solution.
    - Focusing on a minimal viable product (MVP) that covers 90% of the essential features while leaving out the remaining 10% for future iterations.
3. Choose tech for iteration speed.

> The only tech choices that matter are the ones tied to your customer promises.

**Prototype mistakes:**

-   Over-building.
-   Not talking to users.
-   Not letting go of bad ideas.

## Launched stage

Launch in a few weeks.

Quickly iterate with hard & soft data.

-   Make sure you have set up analytics before launch.
-   Pick something simple: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.

Continuously launch.

Balancing building vs fixing.

-   Tech debt is fine. Balance it.

# How the role evolves

Decide what engineering culture will look like.

-   Evolve into leading a small team of engineers.
-   First hires are likely friends.
-   Start to have communication overhead.
-   Your role is morphing
    -   2-5 engineers: 70% time to code
    -   5-10 engineers: coding <50%
